Shells are commonly used to control remote systems, making them a vital part of the attack chain.
A shell is a piece of software a user can utilise to communicate with an OS through a series of commands. 
A shell can also be used with a GUI.

In cyber security a shell is commonly referenced when discussing a particular session on a compromised system.

Attackers can execute a few different attacks when utilising a hsell such as :
	- Remote systel control, allowing for remote control of the target system through commands or software 
	- Privilege escalation, if the shell user is limited as to how much of the system they are able to interact with 
		pivoting around to find ways to escalate privileges gives elevated access such as administrator/root
	- Data exfiltration, once inside the system with file access an attacker can read and copy the data 
	- Persistence or Maintenance Access, once a shell is obtained the attacker can maintain a presence through creation 
		of a new user profile and its associated credentials or copy backdoor software to maintain access to the target system
	- Post-Exploitation activities, after gaining access an attacker can install malware, create hidden accounts and delete/exfiltrate data
	- Access other systems on the network, once access to a network is obtained through one host, an attacker can use it as an initial access point 
		and hop through the network to other targets
